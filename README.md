- 👋 Hi, I’m @E-IckArt ! 🇨🇵

- 👀 Some time ago, I have decided to reinvent my life.
I started learning front-end development & Python by myself in July 2021.
 
- 🌱 I’m currently preparing a Bachelor Web Developer option Java. 
My project : become a fullstack dev & continue to learn.
There is plenty to do, I'm glad ! 🤗

- 💞️ I’m looking to Discover GitHub, and if I have the opportunity, 
to collaborate on projects.

- 📫 How to reach me ? In the next episode ... My LinkedIn! 😉
